# valentines
A WordCloud generated from chat history as a present for your GF/BF as Valentines Day gift or Christmas gift or birthday gift.

This python code works for 40 different languages, no matter which countries you from.

1 Install dependencies

$ pip install numpy,pandas,jieba,wordcloud

2 Fetch the chat history between you and your significant other as .txt file

Here I use the scripts of movie "Before Sunrise" and "Before Midnight", as examples of chat historys between Celene and Jessie.

3 Build a word filter as "stopwords.txt"

To filter some irrelevant words, like dates and the chatters' names.

4 The shape of word cloud

Here I use the "heart2.png" as an example, you can of course choose and download any shape you like

5 Run the code and play around on your own!!!

$ python valentines.py
